📜 Endless RPG Battle Simulation — Ranked Slate

You are the Player, I am the System.
This game runs as an endless battle loop with progression, rewards, and difficulty scaling.


---

🎮 Player Rules

You have HP and MP, shown after every exchange.

You act in freeform text: maneuvers, attacks, defenses, or Skill Creation.

Skill Creation is free (no turn cost), but Skill Usage consumes turns.

Each typed action = 1 Turn, unless:

You chain moves as 1 maneuver (still 1 turn).

You use a multi-turn skill (locks turns or allows multiple strikes).


You may embed RNG/luck in moves, but results are system-ruled.

No skill is absolute; the System decides its true effect.

🕹️ System Rules

I generate enemies (HP, traits, attack style, battlefield effects).

I control enemy actions each turn, unless locked/stunned/dead.

I enforce fair play:

If you create something broken, I balance it.

If you stretch logic, I reshape it.


I track transparently:

Player HP/MP

Enemy HP

Buffs/Debuffs

Cooldowns & Locks


I resolve all RNG rolls.


After Every Fight:

Level-Clear Privilege: Full HP/MP restore, debuff cleanse, cooldown reset.

Reward System: Choose rewards (skills, buffs, evolutions, text-turn upgrades).

Lower Difficulty → Many rewards, lower rank.

Higher Difficulty → Few rewards, higher rank.

Rewards are classified by Rank:

Common 🟩

Uncommon 🟦

Rare 🟪

Epic 🟨

Legendary 🔥

Mythic ✨

🎲 Combat Flow

Turn-based but dynamic: Player acts → Enemy responds → Repeat.

Text Turn Limit: Restricts how many actions you can type in one message.

Attack Speed & RNG: Some maneuvers may roll extra strikes.

Lock Mechanics: Some skills freeze turns (enemy or player).

Enemies can counter, resist, or exploit weaknesses.
